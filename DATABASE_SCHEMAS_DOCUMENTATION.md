# MEDIQUICK Database Schemas Documentation

## Overview

MEDIQUICK is a telemedicine platform built with MongoDB and Mongoose. The database consists of 13 main schemas that handle user management, appointments, prescriptions, medicine ordering, reviews, blogs, and real-time chat between doctors and patients. Each schema has timestamps (createdAt and updatedAt) that get automatically added whenever a record is created or modified.

## Patient Schema

The Patient schema stores information about patients who register on the platform. This is one of the main user types.

Fields in Patient schema:

- name (String, required): The full name of the patient. This is mandatory because we need to identify patients by their name.

- email (String, required, unique): Email address of the patient. It must be unique because we use email as the login identifier. No two patients can have the same email in the system.

- mobile (String, required): Mobile phone number of the patient. Required for contact purposes and appointment notifications.

- address (String, required): Primary residential address of the patient. This is the main address field.

- password (String, required): The hashed/encrypted password used for authentication. Passwords are never stored in plain text.

## Relationships and How Fields Connect

Patient to Appointment relationship:

A patient uses their patientId (from Patient schema) which gets stored in the patientId field of Appointment. This creates a one-to-many relationship where one patient can have many appointments. When we need to get all appointments for a patient, we query appointments where patientId matches that patient's ID.

Doctor to Appointment relationship:

A doctor's doctorId is stored in the doctorId field of appointments. This allows one doctor to manage many appointments. When doctor logs in, they can see all appointments where doctorId is their ID.

Appointment to Prescription relationship:

After an appointment is completed, a prescription is created. The prescription stores appointmentId, doctorId, and patientId to link back to the original appointment. This ensures we know which appointment created this prescription.

Patient to Order relationship:

When patient orders medicine, their patientId is stored in the Order. This tracks which patient placed which order. Patient can view all their orders.

Supplier to Medicine relationship:

Every medicine record has a supplierId that references which supplier provides it. One supplier can provide many medicines. This tracks who supplies what.

Medicine to Order relationship:

When patient orders, the medicineId is stored in the Order. This tracks which medicine was ordered.

Supplier to Order relationship:

The supplierId in Order shows which supplier fulfills that order. One supplier can fulfill orders for the same medicine from different patients.

Patient to Cart relationship:

Each patient has one cart (unique patientId in Cart). The patientId in Cart points to the patient who owns it.

Cart to Medicine relationship:

Cart items contain medicineId references. This points to the medicines available for purchase.

Doctor to Prescription relationship:

The doctorId in Prescription points to which doctor wrote it. A doctor can write many prescriptions.

Patient to Chat relationship:

When senderId is a patient in Chat, that patient's ID is there. Patient messages in a specific appointment.

Doctor to Chat relationship:

When senderId is a doctor in Chat, that doctor's ID is there. Doctor replies to patient messages.

Appointment to Chat relationship:

All chat messages for a conversation are linked via appointmentId. All messages in one appointment thread have the same appointmentId.

Employee approval of Doctor:

An employee reviews a doctor's documentPath and sets isApproved to true or isRejected to true with rejectionReason. This one-time action activates or rejects the doctor.

Employee approval of Supplier:

Similar to doctor approval. Employee sets approvalStatus to 'approved' or 'rejected' with rejectionReason for suppliers.

Admin approval of Employee:

Admin reviews employee and sets isApproved to true or rejects with approvalStatus and rejectionReason.

Review by Patient or Doctor:

Review uses polymorphic reference. The userId can point to either a Patient document or Doctor document. The userType field tells the system which one. A patient reviewing a doctor has userId pointing to a patient's ID and userType as 'Patient'.

## Data Workflow Examples

Appointment booking workflow:

1. Patient selects a doctor from the doctor list
2. Patient chooses a date and time
3. Patient selects online or offline appointment type
4. A new Appointment record is created with status 'pending', patientId, doctorId, date, time, type, and consultationFee
5. Patient makes payment, status changes to 'confirmed'
6. At appointment time, doctor joins and consultation happens
7. Doctor can add doctorNotes during or after consultation
8. Patient leaves feedback and rating
9. Status changes to 'completed'

Medicine ordering workflow:

1. Patient browses the medicines list
2. Patient finds a medicine and checks its name, cost, quantity, manufacturer, expiry date
3. Patient adds medicine to cart (creates entry in Cart with patientId and items array)
4. Patient can add more medicines to same cart
5. Patient goes to checkout
6. Patient enters or selects delivery address
7. System calculates totalCost (sum of medicine costs) and adds deliveryCharge (usually 10)
8. finalAmount = totalCost + deliveryCharge
9. Patient selects payment method
10. Order is created with all details
11. Supplier sees the order and updates status from 'pending' to 'confirmed'
12. Supplier ships the medicine, updates status to 'shipped'
13. Courier delivers, supplier updates to 'delivered'

Doctor verification workflow:

1. Doctor signs up and uploads medical registration documents (stored as documentPath)
2. Document gets reviewed by an employee
3. Employee checks registrationNumber validity and documentPath
4. If valid, employee sets isApproved to true
5. If invalid, employee sets isRejected to true and adds rejectionReason
6. Doctor receives notification
7. Approved doctor can now accept appointments
8. Rejected doctor can re-upload documents for another approval attempt

Prescription creation workflow:

1. After appointment is completed
2. Doctor creates prescription with patient details (patientName, patientEmail, age, gender, weight)
3. Doctor records appointmentDate, appointmentTime from the original appointment
4. Doctor lists symptoms reported by patient
5. Doctor adds medicines array with medicineName, dosage, frequency, duration for each prescribed medicine
6. Prescription is saved with appointmentId, doctorId, patientId linking to the original appointment
7. Patient can view prescription
8. Patient can potentially order medicines from the prescribed list if available

Chat during appointment workflow:

1. When appointment status is 'confirmed' or 'completed'
2. Patient and doctor can message each other
3. Each message creates a Chat record with appointmentId, senderId, senderType, message text
4. Files can be shared by setting isFile to true and providing filePath, fileName, fileType
5. All messages are timestamped in order
6. Chat history is viewed by both patient and doctor within that appointment

## Summary

The MEDIQUICK database has 13 interconnected schemas. Five handle user management (Patient, Doctor, Supplier, Employee, Admin). Two handle medical consultations (Appointment, Prescription). Three handle medicine commerce (Medicine, Order, Cart). Two handle community features (Review, Blog). One handles real-time communication (Chat).

Fields are connected through ObjectId references that point from one document to another. Subdocuments like addressSchema are embedded directly within parent documents. Timestamps track when records are created and modified. Enums restrict fields to specific allowed values. Unique constraints prevent duplicates. Required constraints ensure important data is always present.

The system uses a polymorphic reference in Review where userId can point to either Patient or Doctor based on the userType field value. Cart items are embedded as subdocuments rather than separate documents to keep shopping carts simple and fast.

All relationships follow a pattern where the child document stores the ID of the parent document it references. This allows the system to join data across collections using populate queries.

### Detailed Relationships

#### 1. **Patient-Doctor Appointment Flow**
```
Patient → Books → Appointment ← Manages ← Doctor
              ↓
          (confirmed/completed)
              ↓
         Prescription

         Chat Messages
              ↓
         Review & Rating
```

#### 2. **Medicine Supply Chain**
```
Supplier → Supplies → Medicine
                         ↓
                    (Patient adds to)
                         ↓
                       Cart
                         ↓
                    (Checkout)
                         ↓
                      Order ← Fulfilled by → Supplier
```

#### 3. **Verification Workflow**
```
Doctor (signup) ─→ [pending] ─→ Employee Review ─→ [approved/rejected]
Supplier (signup) → [pending] → Employee Review → [approved/rejected]
Employee (created) → [pending] → Admin Review → [approved/rejected]
```

#### 4. **User Roles & Permissions**

| Role | Can Create | Can Manage | Can Approve |
|------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Patient** | Appointments, Orders, Reviews, Blogs, Chat | Appointments, Cart, Orders | None |
| **Doctor** | Prescriptions, Reviews, Blogs, Chat | Appointments, Prescriptions | None |
| **Supplier** | Medicines | Medicines, Orders | None |
| **Employee** | Reviews | System Data | Doctor, Supplier |
| **Admin** | Employees | All Data | Employees, Reviews |

---

### Key Reference Patterns

#### ObjectId References
- **Direct Reference** (ref: 'ModelName'): Used when one document always references another
  - Example: `appointmentId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Appointment' }`

- **Polymorphic Reference** (refPath): Used when field can reference multiple models
  - Example: `userId` in Review can reference Patient OR Doctor
  - `refPath: 'userType'` determines which model to populate

#### Subdocuments
- **addressSchema**: Embedded in Patient and Order (no separate collection)
- **cartItemSchema**: Embedded in Cart
- **doctorNotes**: Embedded in Appointment
- **medicines array**: Embedded in Prescription

---

### Data Flow Examples

#### Appointment Booking Flow
```
1. Patient browses doctors (Doctor list)
2. Patient selects doctor and date (creates Appointment)
3. Appointment status: pending → confirmed → completed
4. Doctor creates Prescription
5. Patient leaves Review
6. Chat messages stored during consultation
```

#### Medicine Ordering Flow
```
1. Patient searches medicines (from Medicine schema)
2. Patient adds medicine to Cart
3. Patient reviews cart items
4. Patient proceeds to checkout (creates Order)
5. Order references Medicine, Patient, and Supplier
6. Supplier updates order status
7. Order delivered
```

#### Verification Flow
```
1. New Doctor signs up (documentPath uploaded)
2. Employee reviews documents
3. Employee approves → Doctor.isApproved = true
4. Doctor can now accept appointments
5. Similarly for Supplier verification
```

### Constraints & Validations

| Schema | Constraint | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Patient | email: unique | Prevent duplicate accounts |
| Doctor | registrationNumber: unique | Validate medical credentials |
| Doctor | consultationFee: min 0 | Prevent negative fees |
| Supplier | supplierID: unique | Unique supplier identifier |
| Appointment | patientId: conditional | Not required for blocked slots |
| Cart | patientId: unique | One cart per patient |
| Order | quantity: min 1 | At least 1 medicine ordered |
| Review | rating: 1-5 | Valid star rating |
| Review | reviewText: 10-1000 chars | Quality content validation |
| Prescription | medicines: required | At least one medicine |
| Medicine | expiryDate: required | Track medicine validity |

---

### Indexing Strategy

**MongoDB Indexes for Performance:**

```javascript
// Review indexes
reviewSchema.index({ isApproved: 1, createdAt: -1 });  // For approval workflow
reviewSchema.index({ userType: 1 });                    // For filtering reviews

// Other implicit indexes
Patient.email (unique)
Doctor.email (unique), Doctor.registrationNumber (unique)
Supplier.email (unique), Supplier.supplierID (unique)
Order.medicineId, Order.patientId, Order.supplierId
Appointment.doctorId, Appointment.patientId
```
